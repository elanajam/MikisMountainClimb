Game Name: Miki's Mountain Climb 🐈 🏔️

In this game, you play as my cat Miki, who is training for the next rock 
climbing olympics. The goal is to climb the rock climbing wall, as long as you can,
while avoiding falling snowballs from above. There will be a seasonal mode that add an 
extra layer of complexity to the game: “windy season” will have gusts of wind coming from 
the left or right, which affects the way Miki jumps. 
Miki will have four lives, and he loses a life when he collides with 
an obstacle, or falls off a rock.

💥 Miki has power ups, but you need to purcahse them in the in-game store with coins.
💰 The coins can be collected while climbing the rock wall.
